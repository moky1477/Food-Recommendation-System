Recipe Recommender System 🍽️
This project is a Recipe Recommender System built using Streamlit, Machine Learning, and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to suggest dishes based on user preferences. It provides two core functionalities:

Dish-Based Recommendation: Suggests dishes based on a user’s liked dish.
Ingredient-Based Recommendation: Suggests dishes based on a user’s input ingredients.
Key Features
